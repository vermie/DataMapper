This library has the following two folders:

_DATABASE: contains the schema for the sample database, installed to (local)\SQLExpress
_TESTHARNESS: the test harness for the datamapper. This is the full solution.



This library needs the following features implemented:

1.- support for old style ObjectContext
2.- creating of a conventions concept to help control the common conventions the datamapping should use and not use
3.- support for field level auditing when submitting changes
